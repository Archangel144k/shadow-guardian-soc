# Shadow Guardian SOC Platform - Copilot Instructions

This is a React TypeScript project for building an advanced cybersecurity Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard called "Shadow Guardian". 

## Project Overview
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons, Recharts for data visualization
- **Theme**: Dark cyberpunk/hacker aesthetic with matrix-style animations
- **Purpose**: Enterprise cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection platform

## Code Style Guidelines

### UI/UX Patterns
- Use dark color scheme with cyberpunk aesthetics (blacks, grays, neon colors)
- Implement matrix rain effects and scanline animations for cyberpunk feel
- Use monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) for authentic terminal/hacker look
- Include glitch effects and cyber-themed visual elements
- Maintain professional SOC dashboard functionality beneath the aesthetic

### Component Architecture
- Create modular components for different SOC features (threats, tools, analytics)
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implement proper state management for real-time monitoring data
- Follow React best practices with hooks and functional components

### Security Theme Elements
- Authentication flows with multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (clearance levels: PUBLIC, SECRET, CLASSIFIED, APEX)
- Security tool integrations (Suricata, Elasticsearch, Graylog, Wazuh, etc.)
- Threat detection and incident response workflows
- Training/learning modules for cybersecurity education

### Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS with custom cyberpunk color palette
- Implement backdrop-blur effects and glassmorphism
- Add subtle animations and transitions
- Use gradients and glowing effects for UI elements
- Maintain responsive design for different screen sizes

### Data Visualization
- Use Recharts for security metrics and analytics
- Implement real-time updating charts and graphs
- Create interactive dashboards for threat monitoring
- Display security tool status and performance metrics

## Key Features to Implement
1. Authentication system with demo credentials
2. Real-time threat detection simulation
3. Security tools management interface
4. Incident response workflows
5. Training academy for cybersecurity education
6. Threat hunting capabilities
7. System hardening recommendations

## Development Notes
- Prioritize visual impact while maintaining functional SOC capabilities
- Simulate realistic cybersecurity data and scenarios
- Include educational content about cybersecurity tools and techniques
- Ensure the interface feels authentic to security professionals

When generating code, focus on creating an immersive cybersecurity experience that combines visual appeal with practical SOC functionality.
