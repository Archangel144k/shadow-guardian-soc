```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://qrgbhlujkjfbqvcybxbl.supabase.co

```

### 2. Supabase Connection Status

- ✅ Backend Integration: Connected to Supabase with fallback to demo data
- ✅ Progress Tracking: Both local state and database persistence
- ✅ Real-time Updates: Progress saved to Supabase when possible

## How to Test the Training Academy

1. **Login to the app** at http://localhost:5173
   - Use demo credentials (shadowadmin/StealthOp2024! or any from the user database)

2. **Navigate to Training Academy**

## Troubleshooting

### If Training Modules Don't Load
- The app automatically falls back to demo data with rich content
- Check browser console for any errors
- Verify the .env file is in the root directory

### If Progress Doesn't Save
- Demo mode: Progress is saved in browser state
- Supabase mode: Progress attempts to save to database, falls back to local state if it fails

### If Supabase Connection Issues
